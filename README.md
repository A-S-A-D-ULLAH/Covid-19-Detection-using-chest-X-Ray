# Covid-19-Detection-using-chest-X-Ray
In this project we detect Corona virus through chest x-ray. We have dataset of positive and negative x-ray images. So we use sequential model. If you give image of x-ray it will extract feature from it. Then on those feature it predict the result. Second model we trained is also sequential model in which we did the layers tunning.
